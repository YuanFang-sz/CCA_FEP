# CCA_FEP
Apply CCA on first episode psychosis with data set which contains MRI data and Cognitive Scores

`````````````````````This is my first project, maybe the last(joying)`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
My whole project is based on R, although my coding ability is poor.

I will update my files if I have new work and ideas
You can see the code in Rmd and the results in HTML,but I can't upload my data which is quite a valuable thing in Hopkins.

 I updated a file named "TheWholeSamples2". We do spare CCA on our data set,the method we use is based on the paper of Cedric Huchuan Xia.
 The clustering results are quite promising,but unstable.
