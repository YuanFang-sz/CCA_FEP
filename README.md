# CCA_FEP
Apply CCA on first episode psychosis with data set which contains MRI data and Cognitive Scores

`````````````````````This is my first project, maybe the last(joying)```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````  
My whole project is based on R, although my coding ability is poor.  


I will update my files if I have new work and ideas.  
You can see the code in Rmd and the results in HTML,but I can't upload my data which is quite a valuable thing in Hopkins.

 I updated a file named "TheWholeSamples2". We do spare CCA on our data set,the method we use is based on the paper of Cedric Huchuan Xia.  
 The clustering results are quite promising,but unstable.

  I updated a file named "glm_gtd3.Rmd". We do correction on age,gender and race on patients and controls to forbiden influence of these  
variables. The detail of the method is general linear model with independent varibles being factor variables. So,it's involved in dummy  
variable.   

I hope this messure can work.
